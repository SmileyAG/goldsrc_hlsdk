Map Files:
==========

Two of the opening maps from Half-Life, with their lighting radiosity files, are provided as they contain good examples of some of the most complicated entity scripting to be found within the game. They should serve as a good source for learning how to use the more powerful HL entities like multisource, multimanager, scripted_sequence, AIscripted_sequence, and scripted_sentence.  A third map, env_beam, is a demo map of various beam effects that can be achieved with the env_beam entity.

C1a0d.rmf and C1a0d.rad
Env_beam.rmf
